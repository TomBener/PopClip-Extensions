# Smart Punctuations

The extension enables Pandoc’s `smart` [extension](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-smart) to interpret straight quotes (`"` or `'`) as curly quotes (`“`, `”` or `’`), `---` as em-dashes, `--` as en-dashes, and `...` as ellipses. Nonbreaking spaces are inserted after certain abbreviations, such as “Mr.”

## Install Pandoc
